# woltdater 


Woltdater is a cool Telegram bot which let you know when restaurant is open for reservations.

I found it very frustrating that I should check at wolt.com when a restaurant is open after they have been in a rush.

So i decided to write small bot that will update me when the restaurant is open. 


## Quick Start
* Just use the [bot](https://t.me/woltdaterbot) :smiley:	

## Running your own 
##### Installation
```angular2html
python setup.py install
```


##### Usage  

```angular2html
run_woltdater --api-token YOUR_BOT_API_TOKEN
```

## TODO
* Adding Tests
* Adding option to search restaurant
